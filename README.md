Tiny extension that forces wikiedia to use the old and superior skin

## Installation
### Installing from the .zip
1. Download the source code as a zip (below)
2. Unpack it anywhere
3. Go to chrome://extensions
4. Enable developer mode
5. Select "Load unpacked"
6. Select the folder youunzipped the code to

On Firefox:

1. Download and unzip the same way as above
2. Open the about:debugging page
3. Click the This Firefox option
4. Click the Load Temporary Add-on button
5. Select any file in your extension's directory

### If you want to install from .crx:
Download the crx file, then follow these instructions:

1. Download the .crx file from the GitHub releases.
8. Open the browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
9. Drag and drop the downloaded .crx file into the browser window.
10. A dialog box will appear asking if you want to add the extension to the browser. Click the "Add extension" button to confirm.
11. The extension will be installed and should be visible in the list of installed extensions.

Please note that starting with Chrome v72, the ability to install .crx files directly from chrome://extensions is removed, So if you're using chrome version 72 or later, you should use the chrome web store for uploading the extension and for downloading it, or alternatively you can use a third party tool like "Webstore upload" to upload your extension to chrome web store.

**Brave and other browsers will happily install the extension from .crx - stop using Chrome**
